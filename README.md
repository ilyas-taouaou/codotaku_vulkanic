# Vulkan-HPP RAII Tutorial

Welcome to the **Vulkan-HPP RAII Tutorial**! This project is part of a livestream series demonstrating how to use
**C++23** and **Vulkan-HPP RAII** to create a modern Vulkan rendering application.

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases the use of **modern C++ techniques** with the **latest Vulkan extensions** and **SDL3**. Each
livestream progresses incrementally, refining and expanding the implementation with **cutting-edge Vulkan features** and
best practices.

## 🎥 Livestreams

Each livestream builds upon the previous one, progressively expanding the Vulkan implementation. Here is the list of
livestreams:

1. **[A Colored Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43sDPSSG0-U)**
   ([branch](https://github.com/ilyas-taouaou/codotaku_vulkanic/tree/colored-window)) - Introduction to Vulkan-HPP
   RAII,
   setting up
   Vulkan with SDL3, and rendering a simple color using GPU memory transfer operations.

Future livestreams will be added here as the project evolves.

### **Livestream Plan**

This project evolves **progressively** over multiple livestreams, with each stream's progress being a commit. The first
livestream covers **only the basics**, starting from a colored window using only GPU memory transfer operations, and
future streams will refine and expand on the implementation gradually.

## 🛠 Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++23 or later (MSVC preferred)**
- **Git**
- **CMake**
- **Vulkan SDK (Optional, only for debugging tools like vkconfig)**

## 📝 Notes

- This project is **work-in-progress**, with ongoing improvements and new Vulkan features being added in each stream.
- The initial version **deliberately simplifies** some Vulkan details to keep the first stream focused.
- **vkconfig** is used for validation layers and debugging.
